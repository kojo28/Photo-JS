# Photography-Page

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed and developed a dynamic photography website as a testament to my passion for software engineering and film photography. The purpose of this project was to gain a greater understanding of the fundamentals of web design while exploring the role that JavaScript plays in creating an interactive website. By implementing responsive design techniques, I ensured the website was optimized for viewing on a variety of devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The result was a visually stunning and user-friendly photography website that effectively showcases my work as photogrpaher while providing an enjoyable user experience.
